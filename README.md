Project Details:
Our app is designed for users to share their travel stories on our website.
The application allows users to upload images and information related to their travels.
The images users upload are geotagged for them by the application using the EXIF data from the uploaded images.
Users are also requested to enter cost of the trip so we can run analysis and predictions based on their input.

Data Analysis:
We analyze the trips based on the average cost of the current user and we suggest places in the similar price range.
We suggest nearby locations based on the location extracted out of the current image.
We also map nearby tourist attractions like parks, hotels, museums, amusement parks, shopping malls, places of worship and restaurants.
The stats module presents the overall expenditure of the user grouped by the story.
