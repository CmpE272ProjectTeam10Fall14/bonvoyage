Project Details:
-----------------

Our website is a centralized portal where travelers can create travel stories, keep track of them and share them with other travelers. We have developed our application based on Pinterest where the images uploaded by the user are pinned to a chosen story board. The story board contains details of all the pins that were added to it.  Thus, depicting the travel story related to it. The images users upload are geotagged for them by the application using the EXIF data from the uploaded images.Users are also requested to enter cost of the trip so we can run analysis and predictions based on their input.

We extract the GPS information from the image and give our suggestions based on that. We suggest nearby tourist attraction - restaurants, parks , museums , amusement parks , lodging , shopping malls , zoos , aquarium , airports , place of worship etc. Along with that, we suggest close by places that can be visited by the user based on the details updated by other users in the system.

Whenever user wants to travel, budget becomes very important. We suggest trips based on the user’s average travel expenditure. In order to do that, we collect details on the expenditure incurred by the user during the travel. This is used to gain insights on the user’s typical travel budget. Based on the average travel expenditure of the user we suggest places that can be visited by the user within his travel budget. 


Data Analysis:
---------------
We analyze the trips based on the average cost of the current user and we suggest places in the similar price range.

We suggest nearby locations based on the location that the user wishes to visit.

We also map nearby tourist attractions like parks, hotels, museums, amusement parks, shopping malls, places of worship and restaurants.

The stats module presents the overall expenditure of the user grouped by the story.
